then follow prompts to choose template, name...etc

index.html is at root/ because it is the entry point of the project

absolute urls will be rebased to root

vite can handle outside-root file system locations, which makes it usable in monorepo-based setup

vite supports multi-page apps, with multiple .html entry points

running vite will assume that current directory is root and will try to look for vite.config.js here

default scripts
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
        "build": "vite build", // build for production
        "preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
    }

    preview is ---INTERESTING---, you can use it to see build logs and errors
