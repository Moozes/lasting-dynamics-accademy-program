They were validated by Marisa 

but she gave me some feed back also

	resume
		Add motivation
		Add future stuff
		Add open to relocation

		for older experience (if you dont want to add bullet points add a small description, what is the project, your contribution and tech stack)

		You can have 2 pages if you have > 3 years experience

		she also noted that the font syles are differrent in multiple sections, maybe find another template

	linkedin: 
		Remove projects from experience
		Add projects section (should be a paragraph not bullet points)
		
		7 points max for each experience
		less text in each bullet point
		split promotions in the same company (add bullet points for each position)
