Some jobs say apply if you are eligible to work in germany for exmaple
what they mean is that you have a visa, that is it
if you dont have visa you can still apply and work on your visa after you can an offer (a contract)

some jobs say they dont provide visa sponsor ship
you can still apply and work on your own visa
all you need is a contract (an offer) so german embassy gives you visa

there are 2 types of help to expect from a company
visa sponsorship
relocation sponsorship
these 2 are not the same
