git workflow
    pull main
    create feature branch
    work on it
    push feature branch to create remote feature branch
    keep working on it
    push again to remote feature branch
    finished?
    create pull/merge request
    wait for feed back
    if accept good
    if conflict
        pull main
        merge main into feature branch (and not the reverse)
        push to remote feature branch
        git host will automatically detect the ability of automatic merge
        pull request merged and closed

    Note: 
        only pull main branch when resolving a conflict 
        --or-- 
        creating a new feature branch because you need your feature to be as close as possible to main 

NOTE
    merge request is equivlant to pull request (different git hosts use different names)
        it is a way to create a discussion, get code review, comment...etc on the feature branch to merge before merging 
        use this approach even if you are developing alone
