All lifts occur within normal lower arm distance and from floor level to waist height (the handle is placed about 10 cm above floor level). One carton weighs an average of 12 kg and is lifted an average of 12 times per hour per working day (which is eight hours). The other weighs 25 kg and is lifted once per working day. No other aggravating/influencing factors arise, see Figure 31. Assessment of average case: Since the heavy carton is rarely lifted, only the carton that weighs 12 kg is assessed. The frequency and weight factor is obtained from Table 1: 12 times per hour (lie in the range ”7.6 – 12 times per hour”) and 12 kg (lies in the range ”over 10 kg – 15 kg”) give frequency and weight factor 3.8.  We find from Table 2 that the working area factor for lifting from floor level within working distance (2.0) is higher than that for lifting to waist height within lower arm length (0.9), which means that a working area factor of 2.0 is selected. These two factors are entered in Table 3 in the “Factor” column and the assessment for “Risk score 1” is 7.6 and red. Assessment of worst case: Assess the lift of the 25 kg carton, which is lifted once per working day. In this case the frequency and weight factor is 5.4 and the working area factor is 2.0.
