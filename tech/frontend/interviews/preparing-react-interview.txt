Hello i am Moussa a frontend developer in Attraxia, and i'll be interviewing you for your frontend skills

Please introduce your self and talk a little bit about your past experience in frontend development


=================================================================================================
Q: What is the meaning of keys in React, and why are they important when rendering lists?
A: They are important because they help maintain the correct order and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

=================================================================================================
Q: List some cases when you should use Refs in React, and explain their purpose in those scenarios.
A: Refs allow you to interact with elements or values outside the typical React data flow. 
   For direct manipulation (e.g., focus input, scroll). 
   To persist data across renders without causing re-renders.

=================================================================================================
Q: What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback in React, and when would you use each?
A: useMemo: Memoizes the result of a function to avoid recalculations on re-renders. Use it for expensive calculations that need to be re-used.
   useCallback: Memoizes the function itself to prevent unnecessary re-creations. Use it when passing functions as props to avoid triggering child re-renders.

=================================================================================================
Q: What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect in React, and in what scenarios would you prefer one over the other?
A: useEffect: Runs after the render is committed to the screen. Use it for side effects that donâ€™t affect layout (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).
   useLayoutEffect: Runs synchronously after all DOM mutations but before the screen is updated. Use it when you need to measure or modify the DOM before the user sees it (e.g., for layout calculations).

=================================================================================================
Q: Have you created custom React hooks? If so, can you provide examples and discuss their use cases?
A: 

=================================================================================================
Q: Describe a particularly challenging problem you encountered while working on a React project and how you solved it, focusing on technical depth and problem-solving skills.
A: 

=================================================================================================
Q: How do you optimize the performance of a React application, especially in terms of rendering speed and memory usage? 
A: Explain techniques such as lazy loading, caching, optimizing rerenders, virtualization, and memoization.

=================================================================================================
Q: Can you discuss your approach to designing highly reusable and composable React components?
A: Single Responsibility: Each component should do one thing well, making it easier to reuse and test.
   Props-Driven: Use props to pass data and customize behavior, ensuring components are flexible.
   Custom Hooks: Extract reusable logic into hooks to keep components focused on rendering.
   Controlled vs. Uncontrolled: Design components to be controlled or uncontrolled based on the use case, allowing for better flexibility.
   Style and Theming: Use a consistent theming system or styled-components to allow easy customization across different contexts


=================================================================================================
Q: Discuss your experience with implementing internationalization (i18n) in React applications. in other words how do you implement multi language solutions?
A: Setup: Install and configure react-i18next with language resources (JSON files) for each supported language.
   Translation: Use the t function to translate strings within components and Trans component for more complex scenarios (e.g., with JSX).
   Language Switching: Implement a language switcher that allows users to toggle languages dynamically, updating the app's content on the fly.
   Fallbacks: Ensure that fallback languages are in place to handle missing translations gracefully.
   Formatting: Handle number, date, and currency formatting based on locale, using i18n's built-in capabilities or additional libraries like Intl.

=================================================================================================
Q: How do you handle errors gracefully in React applications, particularly those occurring during rendering or asynchronous operations?
A: Error Boundaries: For catching and handling errors in the rendering phase of React components.
   Try-Catch in Async Functions
   User Feedback


=================================================================================================
Q: Have you worked with advanced state management solutions other than Redux, such as Recoil, Jotai,or Zustand?
   If so, what were the advantages and challenges? 
   Please discuss a complex challenge you faced while managing states.
A: redux challenges: Boilerplate Code: Redux often requires a lot of setup with actions, reducers, and store configuration, leading to verbose code.
                     Complexity: Managing a global state across a large application can become complex, especially as the state grows and more features are added.

=================================================================================================
Q: How do you handle security concerns in React applications, such as preventing XSS attacks or securing client-side routing? 
A: avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML 
   sanitize inputs, never trust user input 
   use private routes


=================================================================================================
Q: Did you ever use material UI?

=================================================================================================
Q: How flexible is Material UI for customizing components? Can you easily override styles and themes?
A: Styled Components: Use the styled() utility or makeStyles to create custom styles for components, leveraging CSS-in-JS.
   Theme Overrides: Customize the theme globally by overriding component styles within the theme object, which applies across the entire application.
   SX Prop: The sx prop allows inline styling using a theme-aware syntax, providing quick and context-specific customizations.
   Class Names: Override styles using traditional CSS or by applying custom class names to components

=================================================================================================
Q: Theming: How does Material UI handle theming? Can you create and apply a custom theme across an entire application?
A: Theme Creation
   Theme Provider
   Dynamic Theming based of user preference (for ex: light/dark)

=================================================================================================
Q: Give me fodler structures and architectures that you've worked with before?


=================================================================================================
Q: Can you explain feature branchs in the context of version control systems like Git?


=================================================================================================
Q: How do you manage server state, queries, caching, revalidation...
