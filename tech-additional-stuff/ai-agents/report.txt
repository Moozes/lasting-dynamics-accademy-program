Some guidelines and tools to work with

If you dont know what you want
    1.claude + the research mode for new projects or big ideas
    for example: i want to make a voice ai using aws, twilio and im open to working with openai sdk, but do suggest other stuff if it is better
    the ai will ask you some follow up questions, 
    it will take some time, and it will give you a report with sources
    it a very good starting point for a new project or a new big idea

Ifyou know what you want 
    2.CLI: claude code
    it has some good applications and bad applications
    you need to know what you want
    it works better if you give it a starting context or starting point
        for example: generate test for all iterators in utilities.ts file

    3.Inline: select a local piece of code and iterate on it
        for example select a function and tell it to genrate comments for it
        

Some other ideas
    when you ask it to do something big tell it to go step by step and ask your permission or review 
    so you do not wait 10mins for it generate some unwanted behavior or for it to go in unwanted direction

    feedback loop: they also talked about something called "good feedback loop" look that up
