    then it's important to go in depth into practices and understand what they are about, but a list of most of them to let you understand there is a whole world behind this:
        https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/agile-methodologies/
        https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/

    and for each practice of those 4 investigate what they are and how to practice them:

manifesto
    4 values
        Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        Working software over comprehensive documentation
        Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        Responding to change over following a plan

    12 principles
        Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
        Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

project managment
    project: a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result
    operation: day-to-day repetitive tasks

    there are alot of methodologies: team level, organization level, program level...etc
    there are IT specific and other that can be applied to IT/non-IT projects

    **stages of project managment**
        *Initiating: The goal for this phase is to define the project.
        *Planning: This phase includes developing a roadmap for everyone to follow.
        *Executing & Monitoring: In this stage, the project team is built and deliverables are created. Project managers will monitor and measure project performance to ensure it stays on track.
        *Closing:The project is completed, a post mortem is held, and the project is transferred to another team who will maintain it.





project managment methodologies
    sequential (water fall, critical path, and critical chain )
        all requirements are known from the begining 
        with very definite materials and stakeholder expectations
        good for projects like buildings, construction, physical products
    
    agile is good for
        incremental develompment, responds to change, versatile invironment, feedback driven, client inclusion
        (a sea of different implimentations of the 12 principles)
        **Scrum**
            incrimental dev (sprints) 

            scrum master, product owner (stakeholders), scrum team, 

            product backlog
            sprint backlog
            Sprint burndown chart. track progression

            Set workshops with stakeholders to form product backlog and product vision
            planning at beginning of each sprint, which stories to commit to during this sprint
            daily meeting, to discuss done yesterday, what to do today, (standup meeting => short meeting)
            Grooming meeting:  1 or 2 per week, modify stuff/remove/add items
            sprint demo show to stakeholders at end of each sprint
            retrospective end of sprint: what went wrong and well, to learn and enhance performance

            Don’t stretch/cut sprint time

            Scrum board
                Stories
                Not started (tasks)
                In progress
                Done
                Blockers (optional) 
                Testing (optional)
                Product owner’s review (optional)

            performance metric: velocity chart: stories finished during a sprint compared to initial estimates



        **kanban**
            Kanban methodology is an agile method that aims at continuous improvement, flexibility in task management, and enhanced workflow

            changes are expected, work need to be delivired as soon as it is ready

            continues flow, no sprints

            focuses on visualizing tasks and their states using kanban board
                todo 
                doing
                done

            WIP (work in progress) limit: for example no more then 3 in doing

            doesnt have specific roles like scrum, so it is easy to integrate into companies that already has existing roles and responsibilities 

            principles
                initiate with the existing workflow
                Limit the existing tasks
                Respect existing roles and responsibilities:
                Encourage leadership at all levels

        **Lean**
            Lean agile is a development method that helps teams identify waste and refine processes.

            dont waste time
            Reduce costs
            Improve work quality


            5 principles
                Value:         what customer needs 
                Value stream:  visually maps each of the steps from start to finish + eliminate wasteful steps
                Flow:          ensuring the remaining processes work as effectively and efficiently as possible, which means no delays, disruptions, or bottlenecks.
                Pull:          limiting inventory and work in progress (WIP) items by only producing enough to meet customer demand.
                Perfection: 

        **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**
            It is a collaborative goal-setting methodology used by teams and individuals to set challenging, ambitious goals with measurable results
            --or--
            a popular goal management framework

            Objectives Where do I want to go?
            KRs How do I know if I’m getting there? work as a guide for progress
            Initiatives What will I do to get there

            The OKR Formula
                I will (Objective) as measured by (Key Results).

            help avoid fuzzy thinking

            KRs
                specific and time-bound and aggressive yet realistic

            there is also initiatives

            
            time: quarterly (personal), annualy (organizational)

            extension of MBO (Management by Objectives)


            3 objective types: Committed, Aspirational, or Learning

            example 
                Run a 10K in under 50 minutes by June.
                Go for a run 3x/week for at least 30 minutes.
                Increase distance of run by 1 mile every week.
                Increase mile speed by 5 seconds every week.

        **TDD**
            a style of programming in which 3 activities are tightly related: 
            coding, 
            testing (in the form of writing unit tests) 
            and design (in the form of refactoring). 

            steps
                write test
                run test => should fail
                write enough code to pass the test
                refactor: eliminate repetition, and enhance code 
                repeat

            senior devs say : you will meet delay at the begining of a project  when using TDD but ot gives high quality code

            since agile relays on constant feedback, well TDD  is built to offer such feedback early on. 
        
        **XP**
            another agile framework
            is the most specific of the agile frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development.

            5 values
                Communication to learn
                Simplicity simple system for maintenance
                Feedback 
                Courage
                Respect

            practices (there are alot of them)
                Sit Together
                Informative Workspace
                Pair Programming (2 at 1 machine)
                Stories
                Weekly Cycle (customer select stories) <=> iteration
                Quarterly Cycle <=> release
                Test-First Programming

            roles
                The Customer
                The Developer
                The Tracker track necessary metrics of progress
                The Coach (from outside with XP experience) help guide team

        **Shu Ha Ri** 
            is a Japanese martial art concept that is used to describe the stages of learning on the path to mastery

            it is a good concept to integrate into agile practices, because as we all know agile has alot of learing inside of it

            firstly: Shu – In this beginning stage the student follows the teachings of one master precisely.

            secondly: Ha – At this point the student begins to branch out. With the basic practices working he now starts to learn the underlying principles and theory behind the technique, and learn from multiple masters

            thridly: Ri – Now the student isn’t learning from other people, but from his own practice

OKRS vs KPIs. key performance indicators
    They’re measures for change, whereas KPIs are measures of health and performance of existing processes.

PRiSM if project is oriented towards environmental integration

Lean for minimum viable product, cost effective, 

FDD: in depth feature documentation

user story: something a user wants, eg: i would like to be able to add/delete an account

WIP: work in progress

Epics: 
    large user stories that cant fit into one sprint: they get divided into smaller user stories
    or they can be viewed as a category/goal for multiple user stories in the backlog

Cycle (for kanban) time is the amount of time it takes for a unit of work to travel through the team’s workflow – from the moment work starts to the moment it ships.

scrum vs kanban https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban 
    sprints (ie, 2 weeks)             Continuous flow
    release At the end of each sprint if approved by the product owner	       	Continuous delivery or at the team's discretion
    roles: Product owner, scrum master, development team       	No existing roles. Some teams enlist the help of an agile coach.
    metrics: Velocity            Cycle time
    Teams should strive to not make changes to the sprint    Change can happen at any time

just in time
    inventory managment system
    we dont fill our inventory (todos in case of software development) untill we need materials
    so it decreases inventory managment effors and cost which emproves production
