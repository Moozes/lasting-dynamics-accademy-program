sync
    it is a communication that happens in real time where both parties expect a response right away
    ex: phone, meeting (physical, vertual), webinars

async
    is the oposit of synchronous communication, where both parties dont expect an immediate response
    it allows people to take time before responding
    ex: email, sms, instant messagin (slack), assigned tasks (trello)

sync vs async
    the main difference is in the response time between messages


sync
    pros
        avoid misunderstanding and back-and-forth
            misunderstanding is handeled right away
        build personal relations with team members
        quick response time for urgencies

    cons
        distracting
        hard for different time zones (US, EUROPE)

    use cases
        one on one
        quick update on something
        retrospectives
        hiring process

async
    main advantage: ability to respond at a time that works for you
    props
        more focus time
            intereupting workers, will make them need more time to resume interupted work
        time zone friendly
            cant have every one live on your day work hours
        flexible response time
            some issues need time to come up with good solutions

    cons
        not suitable for urgent issues (by nature)
            urgent issues need a quick response
        possible miscommunication
            by nature you cant convey all information especially imotions

    use cases
        task managment
        focus intensive problem solving (to avoid distraction)
        status update and reporting 
        blockers warnings (dont wait some meeting to talk about blockers)



what to use?
    there is no companie that uses only one approach of communicatin
    typically you need to find balance between the two, what works best for your company and teams
