NOTE: you can use Pycharm community edition editor which is specificly for python which will include all the necessary stuff to develop in python

Similar to js, we need a intelisense (auto complete), type checker (TS), linter(Eslint), formatter(prettier) 

Here is a complete list of vscode extensions for python development
Python by microsoft
    main feature: intelisense
Pylance
    main feature: enhanced intelisense + type checking
ruff    
    main feature: rust based linter/formatter/code quality checker

no need for a formatter (like "black") because ruff is already a formatter

Django
    django specific features like intelisense, and syntax highlighting for Django templates.
