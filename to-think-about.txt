px unit is the most easy, but not accessible, use rem instead in some cases
use rem for font-size, media queries for accessibility
	and in any other stuff that needs to scale up when user increases browser's default font-size

easy way to convert px to rem 
	calc(16rem / 16) <=> 16px
	calc(200rem / 16) <=> 200px

	--or--
	using variables
	--16px: 1rem
	--10px: 0.625rem



Centerfuges pumps of sonatrach activities is affected by the air temperature, which is changing over time throughout all the day thatâ€™s makes unstable flow and pressure on control room system, so SSS proposing a effective solution to the all companies that have the same problems.

solution: 
	integrate a small piece of hardware to pumps that detects this change and act accordingly depending on the surrounding environmental caracteristics (P: pressure, T: temperature) by changing pumps parameters (Q: debit, V: velocity, P: pressure)
	in short: this piece of hardware will try to keep the pumps flow stable durin different environmental tempratures
	fail safe: human interference (notifyed by an alert system)
