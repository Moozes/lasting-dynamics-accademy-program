STUFF TO ADD YA MOUSSA!!!!

Fix dates problem

I am a problem solver my love of finding solutions was first illustrated in being good at mathematics, then when math got more abstract and detached from reality i discovered the world of computer science. After being involved in various projects i developed good communication and collaboration skills, being a team player and a fast learner i managed to lead several projects from a plan to a reality.

spanning multiple branches of informatics (networks, iot, mobile dev, web dev...) 
i found my passion in web development and especially the frontend side because on top of being a problem solver i like to visualize and see the effect of my solutions.
