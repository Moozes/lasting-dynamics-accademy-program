I had a one on one HR interview with Marisa, and we went through a mock interview

she gave me a little bit of advice on how to answer

and she gave me a review on my cv and linkedin page

then after the interview she sent me a word document with common HR questions and some answers and some links to good linkedin profiles

advices she gave me about linkedin
    * add tech stack to linkedin oneliner (the phrase under the profile picture)
    * add some of your acheivements and your tech stack in the about section
    * in wergonic bullet points i have Frontend Lead with bullet points, and Frontend engineer with no bullet points
        she said to add bullet points for each position
    * in sobiapi i have the tech stack mentioned in the bullet points
        she said to use linkedin form to add the tech stack not the bullet points
        because it is searchable by linkedin like that and it is more obvious to recruiters
        and bullet points should focus and tasks and acheivements

advices she gave me about CV
    Add tech stack to experience
